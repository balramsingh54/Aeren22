                                                Confidentiality) are of importance to Jupitice and monetary compensation
                                                may not constitute adequate relief and remedy to Jupitice for

                                            <h6>Restrictions</h6>
                                            <p>The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute
                                                between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law,
                                                (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there
                                                is no right or authority for any dispute to be arbitrated on a

                                                is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported
                                                representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other

                                            <h6>Exceptions to Arbitration</h6>
                                            <p>The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the
                                                above provisions concerning binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes
                                                seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the
                                                intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or
                                                arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or
                                                unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this
                                                provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party
                                                will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this
                                                provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be
                                                decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed
                                                for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal
                                                jurisdiction of that court.</p>

                                            <p>For Hourly Contracts, the Client may dispute ADR Practitioner’s hours
                                                invoiced on the Hourly Invoice for the prior week (Sunday 12:00 a.m.
                                                midnight IST to Sunday 11:59 p.m. IST) during the five days following
                                                the close of the weekly invoice period (Monday 12:00 a.m. midnight IST
                                                to Friday 11:59 p.m. IST) (the “Dispute Period “). It's Client’s
                                                responsibility to review the Hourly Invoice of each Hourly Contract on a
                                                weekly basis and to file any disputes during the Dispute Period. Once
                                                the Dispute Period expires, Client is going to be deemed to have
                                                accepted the ADR Practitioner Services and the ADR Practitioner Fees and
                                                can no longer dispute them. Disputes handled by Jupitice can only
                                                address the hours billed, not the quality of the ADR Practitioner
                                                Services or the Work Product provided under Hourly Contracts. If Client
                                                disputes the ADR Practitioner’s hours invoiced within the Hourly Invoice
                                                under an Hourly Contract during the Dispute Period, the Client and the
                                                ADR Practitioner are encouraged to resolve the dispute between them. If
                                                the Client and the ADR Practitioner fail to come to a resolution,
                                                Jupitice will promptly investigate the Hourly Invoice and determine in
                                                its sole discretion, whether an adjustment is appropriate consistent
                                                with the Client’s and the ADR Practitioner’s instructions in these
                                                Escrow Instructions. Jupitice determination of such dispute shall be

                                            <p>If the Client’s payment is unsuccessful, Jupitice will review the Weekly
                                                Invoice to determine if it qualifies for Hourly Payment Protection. If
                                                Jupitice, in its sole discretion, determines that the Weekly Invoice
                                                qualifies for Hourly Payment Protection, it'll make payment to the ADR
                                                Practitioner to cover the Hourly Invoice on behalf of the Client. In the
                                                event that Jupitice makes payment on behalf of the Client, the ADR
                                                Practitioner hereby irrevocably assigns any right, title or interest in

                                                Client may choose to approve ADR Practitioner’s Weekly Invoice prior to

                                                Invoice. If Client releases payment to ADR Practitioner prior to the end
                                                of the Dispute Period, the Client certifies that it approves the Weekly

                                                Program”) as a mechanism to resolve the dispute. If the funds in dispute
                                                are held in Escrow, the Dispute Assistance Program will continue as

                                                responsibility to review the Hourly Invoice of each Hourly Contract on a
                                                weekly basis and to file any disputes during the Dispute Period. Once
                                                the Dispute Period expires, Client is going to be deemed to have
                                                accepted the ADR Practitioner Services and the ADR Practitioner Fees and
                                                can no longer dispute them. Disputes handled by Jupitice can only
                                                address the hours billed, not the quality of the ADR Practitioner
                                                Services or the Work Product provided under Hourly Contracts. If Client
                                                disputes the ADR Practitioner’s hours invoiced within the Hourly Invoice
                                                under an Hourly Contract during the Dispute Period, the Client and the
                                                ADR Practitioner are encouraged to resolve the dispute between them. If
                                                the Client and the ADR Practitioner fail to come to a resolution,
                                                Jupitice will promptly investigate the Hourly Invoice and determine in
                                                its sole discretion, whether an adjustment is appropriate consistent
                                                with the Client’s and the ADR Practitioner’s instructions in these
                                                Escrow Instructions. Jupitice determination of such dispute shall be
                                                final.</p>
                                            <p>If the Client’s payment is unsuccessful, Jupitice will review the Weekly
                                                Invoice to determine if it qualifies for Hourly Payment Protection. If
                                                Jupitice, in its sole discretion, determines that the Weekly Invoice
                                                qualifies for Hourly Payment Protection, it'll make payment to the ADR
                                                Practitioner to cover the Hourly Invoice on behalf of the Client. In the
                                                event that Jupitice makes payment on behalf of the Client, the ADR
                                                Practitioner hereby irrevocably assigns any right, title or interest in
                                                any payment from Client to Jupitice for the amount paid by Jupitice. The
                                                Client may choose to approve ADR Practitioner’s Weekly Invoice prior to
                                                the end of the Dispute Period thereby releasing payment for the Weekly
                                                Invoice. If Client releases payment to ADR Practitioner prior to the end
                                                of the Dispute Period, the Client certifies that it approves the Weekly
                                                Invoice, accepts the work, and waives any further right to dispute the

                                                funds is irrevocable, except as explicitly provided in these Escrow
                                                Instructions. Without limiting the foregoing, Client’s instruction to

                                                Practitioner is irrevocable. Such instruction is Client’s authorization

                                                release payment to the ADR Practitioner account, Jupitice will transfer

                                            <p>I. Any decision and award of the arbitrator under the ODR Mechanism shall

                                                agreement to arbitrate under the ODR Mechanism or as a waiver of the
                                                right to arbitrate under the ODR Mechanism.</p>
                                            <p>II. As between the Parties, the arbitrator under the ODR Mechanism has
                                                authority and power to grant interim measures and relief, including but
                                                not limited to injunctions, performance, or the other applicable
                                                equitable relief (“Interim Relief”). Where an Interim Relief is
                                                enforceable by a court of skilled jurisdiction according to relevant
                                                laws, a Party’s request/application for Interim Relief shall be made to
                                                the arbitrator under the ODR Mechanism first. However, if, consistent
                                                with any applicable laws of the relevant enforcement jurisdiction(s)
                                                concerned, the arbitrator is not authorized to grant any such Interim
                                                Relief and/or any such Interim Relief would be unenforceable by the
                                                court of competent jurisdiction of the relevant enforcement
                                                jurisdiction(s) concerned, a Party may then (a) request the arbitrator
                                                to transfer the Party’s request/application for Interim Relief to the
                                                relevant court or (b) request/apply for Interim Relief from the
                                                applicable court and/or enforcement organs of the relevant
                                                jurisdiction(s) directly.</p>
                                            <p>(g) Unless otherwise agreed between the Parties and/or awarded by the
                                                mediator/arbitrator under the ODR Mechanism (as the case may be), each

                                            <p>(h) Each Party hereby acknowledges and agrees that Jupitice will only

                                                using secure socket layer technology (“SSL”). We also use HTTP strict
