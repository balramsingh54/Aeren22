                                            <p>For Hourly Contracts, the Client may dispute ADR Practitioner’s hours
                                                invoiced on the Hourly Invoice for the prior week (Sunday 12:00 a.m.
                                                midnight IST to Sunday 11:59 p.m. IST) during the five days following
                                                the close of the weekly invoice period (Monday 12:00 a.m. midnight IST
                                                to Friday 11:59 p.m. IST) (the “Dispute Period “). It's Client’s
                                                responsibility to review the Hourly Invoice of each Hourly Contract on a
                                                weekly basis and to file any disputes during the Dispute Period. Once
                                                the Dispute Period expires, Client is going to be deemed to have
                                                accepted the ADR Practitioner Services and the ADR Practitioner Fees and
                                                can no longer dispute them. Disputes handled by Jupitice can only
                                                address the hours billed, not the quality of the ADR Practitioner
                                                Services or the Work Product provided under Hourly Contracts. If Client

                                                under an Hourly Contract during the Dispute Period, the Client and the
                                                ADR Practitioner are encouraged to resolve the dispute between them. If
                                                the Client and the ADR Practitioner fail to come to a resolution,
                                                Jupitice will promptly investigate the Hourly Invoice and determine in
                                                its sole discretion, whether an adjustment is appropriate consistent
                                                with the Client’s and the ADR Practitioner’s instructions in these
                                                Escrow Instructions. Jupitice determination of such dispute shall be

                                            <p>If the Client’s payment is unsuccessful, Jupitice will review the Weekly
                                                Invoice to determine if it qualifies for Hourly Payment Protection. If
                                                Jupitice, in its sole discretion, determines that the Weekly Invoice
                                                qualifies for Hourly Payment Protection, it'll make payment to the ADR
                                                Practitioner to cover the Hourly Invoice on behalf of the Client. In the
                                                event that Jupitice makes payment on behalf of the Client, the ADR
                                                Practitioner hereby irrevocably assigns any right, title or interest in

                                                Client may choose to approve ADR Practitioner’s Weekly Invoice prior to

                                                Invoice. If Client releases payment to ADR Practitioner prior to the end
                                                of the Dispute Period, the Client certifies that it approves the Weekly
                                                Invoice, accepts the work, and waives any further right to dispute the

                                                is being committed or attempted, then Client and ADR Practitioner
                                                irrevocably authorize and instruct Jupitice to take such actions as
                                                deemed appropriate, in Jupitice’s sole will and in accordance with
                                                applicable law, in order to avoid or cure such acts, including without

                                            <p>The Client and the ADR Practitioner are deemed to and hereby agree that
                                                the instruction to Jupitice and its wholly owned subsidiaries to release
                                                funds is irrevocable, except as explicitly provided in these Escrow
                                                Instructions. Without limiting the foregoing, Client’s instruction to
                                                Jupitice and its wholly owned subsidiaries to release payment to ADR
                                                Practitioner is irrevocable. Such instruction is Client’s authorization
                                                to transfer funds to the ADR Practitioner account from the Client
                                                account or authorization to charge Client’s Payment Method. Such
                                                instruction is additionally Client’s representation that Client has
                                                received, inspected, and accepted the subject work or expense. Client
                                                acknowledges and agrees that upon receipt of Client’s instruction to
                                                release payment to the ADR Practitioner account, Jupitice will transfer
                                                funds to the ADR Practitioner account, and other Affiliates have no
                                                responsibility to and may not be able to recover such funds. Therefore,
                                                and in consideration of the services described in these Escrow
                                                Instructions and the Terms of Service, Client agrees that once Jupitice
                                                or its subsidiaries or Affiliates have charged Client’s Payment Method,
                                                the charge is non-refundable. The Client and the ADR Practitioner
                                                further agree that the sole manner in which an instruction to Jupitice
                                                is revocable is that if Client and ADR Practitioner have jointly
                                                submitted Supplemental Escrow Instructions in writing and signed by both

                                                of the Refund and Cancellation process as stated in Section 4.4,
                                                Jupitice provides the dispute assistance program administered by
                                                Jupitice and described in this Section 6 (the “Dispute Assistance
                                                Program”) as a mechanism to resolve the dispute. If the funds in dispute
                                                are held in Escrow, the Dispute Assistance Program will continue as
                                                described in Section 6.1. If the funds in dispute have been unconfined,
                                                the Dispute Assistance Program will continue as described in Section
                                                6.2. The Dispute Assistance Program isn't available for disputes filed

                                                Sections 6.1 and 6.2, as applicable. The Dispute Assistance Program is
                                                offered as a form of non-binding assistance to facilitate communication

                                                over funds that are held in Escrow as on the date the dispute is filed
                                                (“Escrow Dispute”). The scope of the Escrow Dispute may cover the whole

                                                of timely response acts as an irrevocable authorization and instruction
                                                to Jupitice to release the funds in Escrow from the Non-Responding party

                                            <p>For Hourly Contracts, the Client may dispute ADR Practitioner’s hours
                                                invoiced on the Hourly Invoice for the prior week (Sunday 12:00 a.m.
                                                midnight IST to Sunday 11:59 p.m. IST) during the five days following
                                                the close of the weekly invoice period (Monday 12:00 a.m. midnight IST
                                                to Friday 11:59 p.m. IST) (the “Dispute Period “). It's Client’s
                                                responsibility to review the Hourly Invoice of each Hourly Contract on a
                                                weekly basis and to file any disputes during the Dispute Period. Once
                                                the Dispute Period expires, Client is going to be deemed to have
                                                accepted the ADR Practitioner Services and the ADR Practitioner Fees and
                                                can no longer dispute them. Disputes handled by Jupitice can only
                                                address the hours billed, not the quality of the ADR Practitioner
                                                Services or the Work Product provided under Hourly Contracts. If Client
                                                disputes the ADR Practitioner’s hours invoiced within the Hourly Invoice
                                                under an Hourly Contract during the Dispute Period, the Client and the
                                                ADR Practitioner are encouraged to resolve the dispute between them. If
                                                the Client and the ADR Practitioner fail to come to a resolution,
                                                Jupitice will promptly investigate the Hourly Invoice and determine in
                                                its sole discretion, whether an adjustment is appropriate consistent
                                                with the Client’s and the ADR Practitioner’s instructions in these
                                                Escrow Instructions. Jupitice determination of such dispute shall be
                                                final.</p>
                                            <p>If the Client’s payment is unsuccessful, Jupitice will review the Weekly
                                                Invoice to determine if it qualifies for Hourly Payment Protection. If
                                                Jupitice, in its sole discretion, determines that the Weekly Invoice
                                                qualifies for Hourly Payment Protection, it'll make payment to the ADR
                                                Practitioner to cover the Hourly Invoice on behalf of the Client. In the
                                                event that Jupitice makes payment on behalf of the Client, the ADR
                                                Practitioner hereby irrevocably assigns any right, title or interest in
                                                any payment from Client to Jupitice for the amount paid by Jupitice. The
                                                Client may choose to approve ADR Practitioner’s Weekly Invoice prior to
                                                the end of the Dispute Period thereby releasing payment for the Weekly
                                                Invoice. If Client releases payment to ADR Practitioner prior to the end
                                                of the Dispute Period, the Client certifies that it approves the Weekly
                                                Invoice, accepts the work, and waives any further right to dispute the

                                                and released. In the event of an Escrow Dispute, funds in Escrow will
                                                remain in Escrow while the Dispute Assistance Program or Arbitration, as

                                            <p>(e) The Parties hereby irrevocably agree and confirm that they elect to
                                                use the ODR Mechanism to resolve this particular Dispute, rather than
                                                other forums (whether online or offline) for dispute resolution. This
                                                Agreement succeeds and replaces any previous dispute resolution
                                                agreements the Parties may have made for or concerning to the particular

                                            <p>(f) Specifically, in the event the Parties elect for binding arbitration
                                                under the ODR Mechanism for resolution of their Dispute:</p>
                                            <p>I. Any decision and award of the arbitrator under the ODR Mechanism shall
                                                be final and binding upon the Parties. For evasion of doubt,
                                                notwithstanding clause (e) above, nothing during this Agreement prevents
                                                either Party from seeking remedies of injunction (including interim/
                                                interlocutory and permanent injunctions), specific performance, orders
                                                for preservation of evidence, assets or conduct, or the other applicable
                                                equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction, and any such
                                                requests shall not be deemed or construed as incompatible with the
                                                agreement to arbitrate under the ODR Mechanism or as a waiver of the
                                                right to arbitrate under the ODR Mechanism.</p>
                                            <p>II. As between the Parties, the arbitrator under the ODR Mechanism has
                                                authority and power to grant interim measures and relief, including but
                                                not limited to injunctions, performance, or the other applicable
                                                equitable relief (“Interim Relief”). Where an Interim Relief is
                                                enforceable by a court of skilled jurisdiction according to relevant
                                                laws, a Party’s request/application for Interim Relief shall be made to
                                                the arbitrator under the ODR Mechanism first. However, if, consistent
                                                with any applicable laws of the relevant enforcement jurisdiction(s)
                                                concerned, the arbitrator is not authorized to grant any such Interim
                                                Relief and/or any such Interim Relief would be unenforceable by the
                                                court of competent jurisdiction of the relevant enforcement
                                                jurisdiction(s) concerned, a Party may then (a) request the arbitrator
                                                to transfer the Party’s request/application for Interim Relief to the
                                                relevant court or (b) request/apply for Interim Relief from the
                                                applicable court and/or enforcement organs of the relevant
                                                jurisdiction(s) directly.</p>

                                                mediator/arbitrator under the ODR Mechanism (as the case may be), each

                                                Agreement and the use of the ODR Mechanism.</p>
                                            <p>(h) Each Party hereby acknowledges and agrees that Jupitice will only

                                                100K. For disputes exceeding the amount of USD 100K, both Parties hereby
                                                agree and confirm to waive and abandon the part of a monetary claim for
